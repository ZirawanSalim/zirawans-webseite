# Framer Design Documentation

This README provides an overview of how to use Framer in the Armband Shop Portfolio project.

## Getting Started

Framer is a powerful tool for designing interactive prototypes and user interfaces. In this project, we utilize Framer to create engaging designs for our armband products and portfolio showcases.

### Installation

To get started with Framer, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- A Framer account.

You can install Framer by running the following command:

```bash
npm install framer
```

### Creating a New Project

1. Open Framer and create a new project.
2. Import your design assets (images, icons, etc.) that you will use for the armband shop and portfolio.
3. Use the Framer interface to design your components and layouts.

### Integrating with the Application

Once you have created your designs in Framer, you can export them and integrate them into your React application:

1. Export your designs from Framer as React components.
2. Place the exported components in the `src/components` directory.
3. Import and use these components in your pages, such as `ProjekteArmband.jsx` and `ProjektePortfolio.jsx`.

### Tips for Using Framer

- Utilize Framer's built-in animations to enhance user experience.
- Keep your design components modular for easier maintenance and updates.
- Regularly preview your designs in Framer to ensure they align with your vision.
